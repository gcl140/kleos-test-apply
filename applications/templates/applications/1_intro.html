                <p>Dear {{ user.first_name }},</p>
                
                <p>Congratulations on completing your A-Level education, and welcome to the first stage of TanSAF Internship selection!</p>
                <p>
                    The TanSAF admissions team will conduct the selection of its new interns for the year 2025/26 in <b> 2 main stages</b>. 

The initial stage of the selection process will narrow down the applicant pool to a shortlist. This will be based on the information provided in your TanSAF application form, including your academic results, supporting documents, short answer questions, and essays. Applicants should convey an impression of who they are and why they will make good interns. Ideally, you should reveal qualities demonstrative of, but not limited to, intelligence, leadership, commitment, motivation, resilience, and communicative ability. If you are selected for the shortlist, you will receive an email with details about the second stage of the selection process.
</p>
                
                <p>
                    A select number of candidates will be invited for the next stages—group and personal interviews. After these, further details will be provided to the short-listed candidates. The students selected for the program will be informed by email or phone a few days after the completion of the interviews.
                </p>
                
                <p>The best way to improve your chances of admission to TanSAF is to complete the application that follows as thoroughly, accurately, and genuinely as you can. We urge you to think carefully about your responses, draft them, and revise them before typing in your final version. False or deceitful information on your TanSAF application will result in your application being disqualified for consideration. You are encouraged to complete the application carefully before <b> 2nd June 2025, 11:59 pm</b>, but we encourage you to submit it at least a day before the given deadline.</p>
